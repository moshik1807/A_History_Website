            <h2>Technological Innovations</h2>
            <p>
                The Space Race sparked a wave of technological innovations that continue to shape our world today. 
                Technologies developed for space exploration—such as satellite communications, 
                GPS navigation, advanced materials, and miniaturized computers—have become integral parts of modern life. 
                Many devices we use daily, including smartphones and weather satellites, 
                owe their existence to breakthroughs achieved during the space programs of the 1960s and beyond. 
                The demand for precision, reliability, and innovation in space missions pushed engineers and scientists to develop solutions that later found civilian applications.

            <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
            <p>
                The achievements of the Space Race left a profound cultural legacy, 
                inspiring generations with the idea that humanity could reach beyond its earthly boundaries. 
                Events like the Apollo 11 Moon landing became defining moments of human history, broadcast to millions around the world. 
                These milestones fueled the imaginations of artists, filmmakers, and writers, 
                leading to a boom in science fiction and space-themed media. More importantly, 
                the Space Race ignited a passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) among young people, 
                fostering a new wave of scientists and innovators.

        <section id = "International-Collaboration">
            <h2>International Collaboration</h2>
            <p>
                While the Space Race began as a fierce competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, 
                its legacy evolved into a spirit of international collaboration. 
                Projects like the International Space Station (ISS) symbolize a new era where nations work together to advance space research. 
                Former rivals have become partners, sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise to explore beyond Earth’s orbit. 
                This shift from rivalry to cooperation reflects a broader understanding that the challenges and opportunities of space exploration are best faced together, 
                as a global community.
