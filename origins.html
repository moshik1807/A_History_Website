            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                After World War II, the world divided into two main blocs — the United States and the Soviet Union.
                The tension between these superpowers, known as the "Cold War,"
                was expressed not only through nuclear arms and ideological propaganda but also in the race to conquer space.
                Both countries realized that mastering space technologies was not only a scientific achievement but also a demonstration of military and political power.

                During the 1950s and 1960s, the Space Race became a symbol of the East-West struggle.
                Every satellite launch and manned space mission turned into a prestigious battle. 
                The goal was clear: to be the first to conquer space and show the world which superpower was the most advanced technologically and culturally.

            <h2>Sputnik 1 Launch</h2>
            <p>
                On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world’s first satellite, Sputnik 1, into space. 
                The event shocked the entire world and caused great concern in the United States, which realized that a powerful rival had gained a significant technological advantage. 
                Sputnik was small in size, but its impact was enormous: it marked the beginning of the Space Race and highlighted the strategic importance of space technologies in the superpower rivalry.

                The launch led to the creation of the American space agency, NASA, and extensive efforts to gain technological and space superiority.

            <h2>NASA's Creation</h2>
            <p>
                After the launch of Sputnik 1 and the shock it caused in the United States, 
                a dedicated government agency was established to focus on space research and technology development — thus NASA was born in 1958.
                NASA was created to organize the United States’ efforts to dominate space and achieve scientific and technological breakthroughs that would strengthen its international standing.
                The establishment of NASA marked the beginning of a more intense space race, involving rocket development, manned missions, 
                and preparations for landing on the Moon.

                    I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
