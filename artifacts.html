            <h2>Apollo 11 Space Suit</h2>
            <p>
               The Apollo 11 space suit, officially called the A7L suit, 
               was designed to protect astronauts from extreme temperatures, 
               micrometeoroids, and radiation during their mission to the Moon. 
               Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin wore these suits during their historic moonwalk. 
               The suit included a Portable Life Support System (PLSS) backpack that provided oxygen, 
               temperature control, and communication. 
               Today, Armstrong’s suit is displayed at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and remains one of the most iconic symbols of human space exploration.

            <h2>Saturn V Rocket</h2>
            <p>
                The Saturn V rocket was a powerful launch vehicle developed by NASA to send astronauts to the Moon. 
                Standing at 110 meters tall, it remains the largest and most powerful rocket ever successfully flown. 
                Saturn V was responsible for launching all Apollo lunar missions, including Apollo 11. 
                Its three-stage design allowed it to escape Earth's gravity and deliver the lunar module and astronauts into space. 
                The Saturn V’s engineering success marked a significant achievement in space technology and remains a symbol of American space ambition.

            <h2>Lunar Module Eagle</h2>
            <p>
                The Lunar Module, known as "Eagle," was the spacecraft that carried Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon during Apollo 11. 
                Designed for landing and taking off from the Moon’s surface, Eagle was a two-stage vehicle with a descent and ascent module. 
                On July 20, 1969, the Eagle successfully landed on the Moon, leading to Armstrong’s famous words, “The Eagle has landed.” 
                The module was left on the Moon after the mission, while the astronauts returned in the ascent stage.
